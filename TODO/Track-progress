set up paths
add nested cv to best model selection
average all different metrics and make a decision or just keep sillho metric?
Create a pipeline. 
    - fit and predict to whole dataset and give performance metrics
    - perform nested cv 
    - difference between metric and score. Silho metric and accuracy?
    - Do i have to select models based on metrics
    - use a multi-metric approach on Gridsearchcv parameter scoring
    - column transformer for heterogeneos datasets in my preprocessing module
